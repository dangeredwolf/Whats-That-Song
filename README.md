What's That Song?
==

A Discord bot that finds the song given a video or audio file, using Shazam.

Written in Discord.py ~~because I like torturing myself~~ because ShazamIO exists only in Python form.

## Quick start

1. Install Python 3.8 or later (3.10 recommended) and FFmpeg
2. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Put bot token in `token.txt`
4. Run `wts.py`
5. Profit
